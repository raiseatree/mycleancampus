			<h2>How Does CleanCampus Work?</h2>
			<p>Using their smart phone staff or students report problems on campus, such as fly tipping, broken glass, a light left on, a wonky paving slab, dog dirt or overflowing bins.</p>
			<p>The details of the problem are sent to a key contact on campus. The task is automatically assigned to the responsible person in order to fix the problem. Tasks are scheduled depending on their urgency and can be rejected or prioritised.</p>
			<p>When the job is fixed the status is updated and the original reporter is notified.</p>
